Should
======

This is a python program to manage todos from the command line. It'll
create all the files it needs as it needs them.

The syntax for using should is in a state of flux. It will be updated.

Here's some ideas from my list about should:

 - projects!
 - dependency management / parenting
 - due date and search
 - non-verbose printing format
 - public list / private list in different text files (for example, this
   list of ideas would be public)
 - ability to edit / add tags, projects, due dates from the command line
   interface

Here's the ones I've done:

 - color
 - better command line interface
 - better search (by tags AND/OR projects plus exclusion)
